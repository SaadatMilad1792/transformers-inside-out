# transformers-inside-out
This tutorial is intended to provide a thorough and comprehensive explanation of transformer architectures. It includes detailed discussions of each component and the corresponding code implementations, from the fundamental building blocks to the complete training loop. The tutorial concludes with a practical application of the developed transformer model to an English (en) to Farsi (fa) translation task.
