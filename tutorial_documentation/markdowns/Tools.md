# Tools
Every clean Python project starts with an environment. In this tutorial, you have two options: 

1. **Create your own environment** from scratch.
2. **Use the provided environment** `transformersInsideOutEnviron.yml`, which is the exact environment used for this project.

## Steps to use the provided environment

Follow these steps to set up the provided environment:

1. **Open your terminal or PowerShell** and navigate to the project directory where `transformersInsideOutEnviron.yml` is located.

2. **Create the environment** from the YAML file, and replace `<env_name>` with any name that you prefer:
```powershell
conda env create -f transformersInsideOutEnviron.yml -n <env_name>
```

3. **Activate the environment and start coding!**
```powershell
conda activate <env_name>
```

And that’s it! You’re all set. Your Python environment is ready, and you can start exploring the project.
