# Introduction
Transformer architectures have fundamentally transformed the way machines process and understand sequential data, especially in natural language processing (NLP). They have become the foundation for many cutting-edge models that power language understanding, generation, translation, and even areas beyond text such as computer vision and speech recognition. Unlike traditional sequence models that rely heavily on recurrence or convolution, transformers use a self-attention mechanism to weigh the importance of different parts of the input data dynamically. This allows them to capture complex, long-range dependencies efficiently and to process entire sequences in parallel.

The significance of transformers lies in their ability to scale to very large datasets and model sizes while maintaining strong performance across a wide range of tasks. This capability has led to breakthroughs such as large language models, state-of-the-art translation systems, and more effective contextual embeddings.

This tutorial aims to provide a thorough and clear explanation of transformer architectures, breaking down each component, from tokenization and positional encoding to the encoder and decoder blocks, and how they fit together to form a complete model. Alongside detailed explanations, the tutorial includes practical code implementations to help solidify understanding. The journey concludes with training and using the transformer on an English-to-Farsi translation task, demonstrating how these concepts come to life in a real-world application.

By exploring both the theory and the hands-on aspects, this tutorial offers a comprehensive guide to building and working with transformer models from the ground up.
